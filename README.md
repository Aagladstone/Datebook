The DateBook blends the ideas of a Kanbon model with a calendar. The advantage of using a Datebook of a calendar is to lose all of the white/empty space that a calendar contains, so that you can focus on the dates that actually matter to you. The target audience of the application is for people that look to become more organized, without using a calendar. The Datebook will be able to solve the problem of forgetting important deadlines, meetings, birthdays or anniversaries. 

Instruction Guide:

Welcome to the DateBook.

The Datebook was created to help a user keep all of their events in a row(literally and figuratively). The user will create a new event and fill out a form containing multiple fields(Event name, description, category[work, school, meetings, personal, payment, reminders, misc/random], date, time of day, if the event is recorring[daily, weekly, monthly, yearly], and if they would like to recieve a notificaton about their event).

Once the user has filled out a form, an event card will be created in the "upcoming" portion of the app. When the time for that event comes, the card will slide into the "today" portion of the app. Once the event has past, the card will slide into the past portion of the app. 

Once there is more than one card in the book, the user will also be able to filter out event cards by categories. 

Just by simply clicking on a card the user will be able to edit any portion of the card in the "upcoming" or "today" portion of the screen. On the otherhand, if a card is in the "past" area, it will be uneditable. 

Similarly to the edit feature, any card will be able to deleted with the touch of the trash can icon. 

The users events will be able to synced their DateBook to their google or apple calendar with the touch of a button as well. If the user doesn't want to do this, the Datebook will eventually have the functionality to send out it's own notifications to the user.
